# Recipi

https://myrecipi.herokuapp.com/

Project created and maintained by Nicolai Antonov

This web app seeks to provide registered users with the ability to submit custom Recipis, and then rank those recipes by aggregated votes. Other features include:
- functioning comment field underneath each Recipi
- instantaneous search bar
- toggle to view only current user's posted Recipis
- "Choose For Me" button to randomly select a Recipi
- the option to input a Restaurant and City when submitting a Recipi, which then automatically places a marker at that restaurant location within the built-in Google Map component *

*e.g., User 1 in Austin submits a taco Recipi based on a taco they had at Torchy's, and links it to Torchy's upon submitting. User 2 then searches the map component for nearby Recipi ideas, and comes across User 1's taco Recipi
