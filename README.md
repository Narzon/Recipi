# Recipi

https://myrecipi.herokuapp.com/

Project created and maintained by Nicolai Antonov

This web app seeks to provide users with the ability to submit custom recipes, and then rank those recipes by aggregated votes.

In future updates, the app will utilize the Google Maps API library to connect recipes based on restaurant dishes to the location of said restaurant. This will allow users to search for and submit recipes based on proximity.

>e.g., User 1 in Austin submits a taco recipe based on a taco they had at Torchy's, and links it to Torchy's upon submitting. User 2 then searches for recipes based in Austin, and comes across User 1's taco recipe 

This project is designed to demonstrate full-stack development and deployment, utilization of fetch API, and secure hashing/encryption for managing user authentication and sessions
